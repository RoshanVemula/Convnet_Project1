# About the Project

A simple web app using Flask framework which predicts the car brand upon uploading the car image. In this project I have trained the model using images of Audi, Lambhorgini and Mercedes. The model is build using one of the transfer learning methods, Resnet50 architecture. The web app is created using Flask architecture, html and css. Later the app is deployed into cloud based platform Heroku.
